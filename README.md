[efield](http://www.vizitsolutions.com/portfolio/efield/) - Pure HTML5 Electric Field Visualizations
====================================================================================================

Note that the efield toolkit has been replaced by the more general and better organized
[vfield](http://www.vizitsolutions.com/portfolio/vfield/)

The efield toolkit allows authors and other content creators to quickly build 
easy to understand visualizations of electric fields. Simply specify the position
and type of electric charge, and in some cases the starting points of the
electric fields, and the library generates a three dimensional interactive
model on the web page using WebGL.
