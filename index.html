        <p class="abstract">
          &nbsp;Illustrations and visualizations of the electric field are ubiquitous in online physics
          courses and ebooks. The current generation of devices with their increased graphics and interaction
          capabilities affords an opportunity to significantly improve on even this well established
          paradigm. Further the wide variety of illustrations and interactions demonstrated here
          clearly show the advantages of the newer technology. This toolkit, including the
          documentation, is available in the <a href = "https://github.com/VizIT/efield/">efield
          repository on GitHub</a>.

        <p>
           Both qualitative and quantitative understanding of this foundational material are
          critical to a student's long term success. Effective and clear explanations along
          with intuitive interactive visualizations and simulations enhance understanding and
          invite exploration. This personal interaction and exploration helps the student
          make the transition from what they know to what they need to know.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be effective, the visualization should be as simple as possible while still
         conveying the desired information. The goal is to bridge the gap between a
         student's mental model and a greater level of understanding. If the visualization
         is too far removed from the student's mental model then it will be difficult
         to engage the student and will not be an effective learning tool.
        </p>
        <p>
          When first encountering this material in a two dimensional representation, the
         student must simultaneously understand the physics and extend the representation
         into three dimensions. A three dimensional initial presentation removes the
         requirement to mentally extend the representation into three dimensions,
         allowing the learner to focus on the physical or mathematical content. This is
         be a more effective learning experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          WebGL and OpenGL are particularly well suited for intrinsically three dimensional
         material such as electric and magnetic fields. The example here is initially
         positioned in a similar orientation to common 2D electric field illustrations,
         and should be immediately recognized. In addition, it is reactive to both mouse
         and touch interactions in a standard way. A mouse drag will rotate the diagram
         while a mouse wheel will zoom the image.
        </p>

        <figure class="left">
          <!--A blank area we can draw on with JavaScript. -->
          <canvas id="drawingSurfaceII" width="300" height="300"></canvas>
          <figcaption>This second rendering required only a few moments<br> editing.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Another component of usability for instructional technology it the usability for
         the instructor. This example is constructed entirely in WebGL, HTML and JavaScript.
         The general code is capable of rendering an arbitrary set of charges and field lines
         by specifying the charges and their locations, as well as a starting point for
         tracing each field line.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second diagram is a single positive charge. This different configuration
         required only a few minutes of time to add another canvas element, specify the single
         charge, and the new start points for the field lines.
        </p>
        <p>
         Scaling with changes in size of the canvas are also not an issue. Each frame
         is rendered, or generated, specifically for the canvas drawing surface. This means
         that it will always adjust for the size of the canvas. The size of the canvas can
         in turn be defined by media specific css giving an appropriate image for virtually
         all situations.
        </p>

        <figure class="right">
          <canvas id="drawingSurfaceIII" width="300" height="300"></canvas>
          <figcaption>Another example is identical to the first, except that the charges are no longer equal.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          This third example is the same as the dipole configuration, except the positive
         charge has been doubled. The field is sufficiently complex that constructing it by hand
         would be a challenging task. However, with this toolkit is it a simple change that takes a
         few seconds. For the learner, it is immediately clear that the field lines no longer loop
         from the positive to the negative charge but some fields lines extend out away from the
         system of charges. Also, it is now possible to directly see how the charge appears at a
         large distance by zooming out. It quickly becomes clear that when viewed from a large
         distance the fields becomes close to that for a point charge. That is, the perturbations
         created by the negative charge are less and less evident as the observer draws further
         and further away.
